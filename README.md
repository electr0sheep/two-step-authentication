# Two factor authentication demo website
This repo was intended to be my senior capstone project. I did some initial work on it, but as fate would have it the team decided on [Cry](https://github.com/vuphan314/cry) as our project.

The original idea was to have a lightweight, universal two factor authentication method. Specifically, my idea was exactly what Google implemented with their [two factor auhtentication method](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) that allows a user to select yes or no. Unfortunately, I believe the only service that supports this is Google themselves. Every other service uses TOTP authentication, requiring more than just a simple yes or no press.

In summary, I believe that as developers find ways to promote security without burdening the user, the web will be a much more secure place. This repo was intended to do exactly that.
